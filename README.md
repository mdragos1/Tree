# Tree
This is a little coding project developed for Linux terminals that simulates the tree command from DOS.
The code needs to be compiled first. In the terminal the executable name and a directory name should be written. Finally, after the executable ran, the terminal will print the tree structure of subdirectories and sub-files of the directory specified before.
